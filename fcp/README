This file describes the FCP-Server fcpd

1. What is the Firewall Control Protocol FCP?

FCP is a protocol, which allows remote machines to manage a systems firewall.
It's special purpose is to support opening pinholes in a restrictive firewall
configuration, to allow special internal hosts to communicate with special
external machines. This is especially useful for enabling connections in a
dynamic manner, controlled by a proxy application. IP-Telefonie is a special
target to be addressed.

2. How do I use fcpd?

fcpd is installed on a firewall machine, allowing special internal hosts,
e.g. proxies, to dynamically change filter rules. The fcp daemon is a server
process, which will probably be run by the system init scripts. It is being
configured by a config file.
You will find a commented sample file called fcpd.conf.sample within the
distribution.
You can watch the actions of fcpd by taking a look at syslogs daemon output
(you might want to edit syslog.conf to direct daemons output to a special
file).
You may specify config-file, debuglevel, and daemon mode on command line:

 usage: fcpd [-h] [-d] [-l] [-v]
  -h display this help message
  -d don't run in dameon mode
  -l specify debug level
  -f specify config file
  -v prints out protocol version number and exits

3. What platforms are supported?

This initial version of fcpd is based on linux-2.2 kernel. It uses ipchains
like calls to edit the firewall rules. It will also run on linux-2.4, using
ipchains compatibility mode (modprobe ipchains - need to compile ip-tables
and ipchains as modules).
The server was designed to be easily ported to other platforms by seperating
backend from other code. Ideally it should be enough to rewrite api.c and
recompile on any unix platform, but we didn't test that yet...

4. How do I build fcpd?

Get the tgz package, which has a name like fcp-0.x.tar.gz

$ tar xvzf fcp-0.x.tar.gz
$ cd fcp-0.x
$ ./configure
$ make

then you will find the executable of fcpd in the fcp subdirectory - simply
copy it wherever you want (e.g. /sbin/). fcpd must be run with root
permissions because the netfilter rules need to be changed. It's not
recommended to make fcpd set-uid.
You also have to copy the fcpd.conf.sample to /etc/fcpd.conf and modifiy 
it to your wishes or start always with 'fcpd -f /what/ever/you/want/file'.
Please see the fcpd.conf.sample for the required parameters and what they
modify.
The fcpd rereads the fcpd.conf if he got the HUP signal. But at this time not
all parameters (e.g. Port) will actually change after rereading.

5. I want to write a client app for fcp, what must I do?

First you should take a look a the protocol-specs file within the
distribution. This file describes the complete syntax of FCP 1.0 .
Understanding of firewall filtering rules is required to get it -
for particular behaviour, which isn't stated at the time, simply try out.
Then it's up to you to make use of the dynamically reconfiguration of
the firewall.

6. Security issues

At this moment fcpd isn't secure at all and it should be all to easy to crash
it or to even worse things. The administrator should configure the firewall as
restricitive as possible, allowing only very special hosts to contact fcpd.
Real security mechanisms will be added in future releases.

7. Is it all about opening pinholes?

Yes. At least at the time. The protocol allows complete remote administration
of filtering rules and NAT settings, but the server doesn't yet. The protocol
specification within this package shows what features are supported.

8. Debugging

The Loglevel specified at compile-time and overriden by the config-file entry
controls the amount of debugging messages sent to syslog.
You might want to change syslog to use a seperate file for daemons' log
messages by specifiing a line in /etc/syslog.conf similar to:

daemon.*                        /var/log/daemon

9. Testing

For testing purposes a small skript can do good work (uses netcat, which is
sometimes called nc):

#!/bin/bash
cat testseq | netcat localhost 12345

you can now edit testseq and fill it with a procol command. Watch syslog
and/or ipchains -L for the results of your command sequence.
To evaluate the timeout feature of fcpd, a console running the command

$ watch ipchains -nL

might do good work.

10. Performance Issues

A first test has given the following results:
if logging is reduced to minimum (level 5) 60-80 processed request on an 
700 MHz PC over the loopback device are possible. But the requests were only 
inserting and deleting the same rule every time (means one connection with 2 
request, then a new connection). This isn't the hardest for the deamon.

In a second performance test the fcpd has proven the ability to handle about 
330 Requests per Second on a 750 Mhz CPU. There have been taken 5 Clients on 
a remote host inserting repeatingly 30 rules and removing them directly
after inserting (means one connection with 60 request, then the next client).

In a test which simulates a proxy (one client on another computer than the 
server, with one connection over the hole test) the fcpd (with loglevel 4) has 
handled 4000 requests per second on 700 MHz CPU. (The requests were inserting 
and deleting every time the same rule, so the fcpd haven't to handle much 
rules, and caching effects of the os can't be excluded.)

As you can see opening and closeing of TCP connections limiting the server more
than the amount of the requests.
