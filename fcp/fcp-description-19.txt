FCP protocol description
v.019 - 2001-04-19

SET:
    * inserts a rule according to the PME, _after_ a QUERYNAT returned an ip-
      address and port.
    * is also for used for keep-alive messages by using the timer (s.b.)

RELEASE:
    * deletes a rule, which was inserted by SET

QUERY:
    * returns all rules matching the PME
    * if there's no PME defined, all rules will be returned

QUERYNAT:
    * queries for NAT, by retrieving ip-adress and port for the protocol from
      the fcp-server
    * the result is either the local ip and port (in case there's no NAT used)
      or a reserved but not yet connected port on the firewall, which will be
      used for the connection. Use SET to open the port and start NAT.
    * by using a port-range, a range of Ports is assigned for the range of
      clients' Ports starting at PORT.
    * if no port-range is specified, it defaults to the single Port behaviour.

RELEASENAT:
    * releases a reserved ip and port tuple for the protocol
    * releasing the lowest port of a portrange results in releasing the hole
      portrange
    * deletes a NAT rule

Transaction Number (SEQ):
    * is being used by the server to refer to a clients request.

PROTO:
    * possible values: 1=ICMP 6=TCP 17=UDP (see IANA's Assigned_protocol_number)
    * if not specified: 0=all protocols (or "no change" if used in the
      packetmodifier context)
    * the type of protocol this expression is according to
    * used in QUERYNAT, a value of 1 doesn't make sense and will return status
      code 400

SRCIP:
    * posible values ip-address: from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
    * posible values netmask: from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
    * if not specified: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 (or "no change" if used in the
      packetmodifier context)
    * the ip-adress(es) where the packets (seem to) come from

DSTIP:
    * posible values ip-address: from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
    * posible values netmask: from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
    * if not specified: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 (or "no change" if used in the
      packetmodifier context)
    * the destination ip-adress(es) of the packets

SRCPORT:
    * possible values port: 0 to 65535
    * possible values port-range: "x-y" with x<y and x,y from 0 to 65535
    * if not specified: any source port will be allowed (or "no change" if used
      in the packetmodifier context)
    * the source port or port range

DSTPORT:
    * possible values port: from 0 to 65535 (see IANA's Assigned_port_numbers)
    * possible values port-range: "x-y" with x<y and x,y from 0 to 65535
    * if not specified: any destination port will be allowed (or "no change" if
      used in the packetmodifier context)
    * the destination port or port range

TOSFLD:
    * possible values: frmo 0 to 255 (8 bit mask)
    * if not specified: 0 (or "no change" if used in the packetmodifier
      context)
    * the type of service (see RFC1349 and RFC2474)

TCPSYNALLOWED:
    * possible values: yes, no
    * if not specified: the SYN flag will be ignored
    * defines whether packets with only the SYN flag set are allowed to pass
      the firewall

ICMPTYPE:
    * possible values: all icmp types
    * if not specified: the icmptype will be ignored while matching
    * matches only on the specified icmp-type

ACTION:
    * possible values: pass, drop, reject
    * if not specified: no action will be performed (besides logging if
      specified)
    * specifies what will be done with the packet

TIMER:
    * possible values: 0, 1 to 2^32; 0 indicates infinite timer
    * if not specified: 60
    * sets the timeout in seconds. a keep alive message is needed before the
      timer exceeds.

REFLEXIVE:
    * possible values: yes, no
    * if not specified: no
    * sets whether the rule should be reflexive. this might not be implemented
      within the firewall, so a return status-code 501 is possible. (Note: in
      this case it is still possible to use TCPSYNALLOWED mentioned above)

PRIORITYCLASS:
    * possible values: 0 to 2^32 (=4294967296)
    * if not specified: 0
    * sets the priority class in which the rule will be inserted. Note: if
      action doesnt match the priority class' default ACTION, status code 480
      will be returned. Priority classes are defined within server
      configuration. 0 means default policy.

LOG:
    * possible values: 0 to 255
    * if not specified: 0
    * sets the log-level for the rule. Log Levels are defined in server
      configuration. Anyway 0 means no logging at all. Note: no error will be
      returned if the specified log level isn't configured, instead no logging
      is set. Logging definitions may be configured with time intervals.
    * example configuration might be: log-level 42: log every 10 seconds if
      there was a matching packet.

ICMPMESSAGE:
    * possible values: any of standard icmp-messages (see
      IANA's_ICMP_assigned_number)
    * if not specified: packet will be rejected without any ICMP message.
    * sets the icmp message which will be returnd to the sender of the rejected
      packet.
